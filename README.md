Welcome to the String Matching Visualization repository! 🚀 This repository contains a web tool that helps you visualize string matching algorithms. You can step through the comparison process between a pattern and a text, seeing how the algorithm works its magic! ✨

## Features 🌟

- **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Visualize the step-by-step comparison process between a pattern and a text.
- **Colorful Highlights:** See the characters being compared highlighted in a different color.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Currently supports the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
- **Interactive UI:** User-friendly interface to input patterns and texts.
- **Prompt Notifications:** Receive notifications when a match is found.

## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Input your desired pattern and text.
4. Click the "Start Visualization" button.
5. Watch the magic unfold! 🪄

## Future Scope 🚀

We're constantly working to enhance your experience:

- Adding more string matching algorithms.
- Improving the user interface with more customization options.
- Offering visualizations for complex algorithms like Aho-Corasick and Knuth-Morris-Pratt.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
